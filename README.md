Here are my config and themes for [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

I added some themes including:

1. MaterialUI
2. FlatUI
3. Dracula
4. IndianPalette

### To use these config open `profiles.json` by clicking on terminal settings. Remove all and paste all of these from [here]()
